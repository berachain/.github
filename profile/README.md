## Berachain Foundation

Berachain is an EVM-identical Layer 1 (L1) blockchain that uses liquidity to secure the network and fuel the application layer. Unlike most blockchains that rely solely on traditional staking for network security, Berachain's novel Proof of Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism rewards users who actively contribute resources with the network's native governance token, $BGT.

Berachain offers an EVM-identical execution environment, and leverages the novel BeaconKit on the consensus layer to provide single-slot finality. BeaconKit was developed by the Berachain Foundation to provide a modular consensus layer that is adaptable for teams wishing to build Ethereum-based blockchains.
